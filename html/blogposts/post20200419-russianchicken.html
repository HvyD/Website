			<p>Hey y'all, what's up? Today, I want to share an old family recipe with you. Well, not that old, it's from the 80's. That is really not that long ago, kids&#33;</p>

          <p> Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s was an interesting time for the kids of Generation X. For the first time, it was the norm for kids to be “latch-key” kids, with either a working single parent or both parents working out of the home. As technology evolved, we changed and grew with it. Our parents worked long hours, with long commutes. They were busy and dinner time often became quick out of necessity. Microwave ovens were first made for domestic use in 1967 and their use became widespread in the late 70s and early 80s as parents started looking for even quicker ways to make dinner after a busy day. They were the trendy kitchen cooking appliance in the 80s in the same way the InstaPot is trending these days. </p>
			<div class="right"><img src="../../img/russianchicken/gecookbook.jpg" alt="GE Microwave Cookbook"></div>
			<p>My mom was no exception to this trend. Working long days in San Francisco, followed by a long commute on public transit home, Mom decided to take a course at the local community college to learn cooking techniques for the relatively new cooking device. I don’t remember many good recipes coming out of that, except one dish my mom is pretty good at making, which we called “Russian Chicken” because of the Russian salad dressing used in the sauce. It came from The Microwave Guide &amp; Cookbook, a cookbook written by the great minds at General Electric, who hade become a major distributor of home microwaves by the early 1980s. The GE Cookbook was the textbook for Mom’s course at the community college. </p>

			<p>While chicken <i>can</i> safely be cooked from raw in the microwave, according to the recipe &#40;and the fact that my sisters and I never came down with Salmonella after eating microwaved chicken&#41;&#59; as an adult I have always been a little wary of cooking meats in the microwave. Reheating, defrosting, yeah, but straight cooking it in a microwave kind of weirds me out. But this recipe is tasty, so I converted it to an oven cooked dish back in my early 20s. And it’s still super simple and quick to make.</p>

			<p>Between all the food shortages the stores have had during this coronavirus craziness and my seemingly constant fibromyalgia flare I’ve been in the last few weeks, I have been breaking out some of my simpler dishes for dinner lately.  This one is certainly simple and uses some of the items I already had in the pantry.</p>

			<div class="left"><img src="../../img/russianchicken/rawchicken.jpg" alt="Raw Chicken"></div>
			<p>The entire dish only takes <i>three ingredients</i>. You start with raw boneless chicken. I mostly use chicken breasts, but you can also make this with chicken thighs, if that’s all you have.  I usually use skinless, but that is also up to you. This is a really versatile dish. I have never done it, but I would guess you could even use pork or another poultry if you can’t get chicken for some reason.  Basically, any white meat should work well in this recipe. You cut the meat into chicken tender sized pieces and add to the sauce.</p>

	        <div class="right"><img src="../../img/russianchicken/russiandressing.JPG" alt="Russian Salad Dressing"></div>
			<p>The sauce is easy. It’s basically a “dump dish” style. All you need to do is dump the salad dressing and onion soup mix into a square baking pan and mix it together. &#40;Yeah, one pan dish&#33; Easy clean up&#33;&#41; You can use any onion soup mix and it tastes great. I’ve made it with Lipton mix, store brands, dollar store brands, a couple times I even mixed up my own onion soup mix from a recipe I found on Pinterest. They all work. For the salad dressing, the optimal flavor comes with Russian dressing. I have never found this flavor in any other brand than Wish Bone. I’m not sure if it’s exclusive to them, but I have never found a generic or Kraft or what not of it.  If you can’t find Russian dressing, you can use Catalina or French dressing with decent results.</p>

			<div class="left"><img src="../../img/russianchicken/onionsoup.jpg" alt="Lipton Onion Soup Mix"></div>
			<p>Once you have the sauce mixed, add the chicken into the pan and bake at 400&#8457; for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. I usually serve it with either rice, bread or rolls, but of course, you can choose whatever you have available. If serving with rice, it is really good if you serve it in a bowl and drizzle some of the sauce into the rice as well. </p>

		<p>Anyway, I hope y’all enjoy this recipe. It has been a family favorite since I was a kid, and hopefully you will enjoy it too. Oh, I have no idea how long or what temperature my mom used in the microwave for it. I guess if you really want to know, you could hunt down the cookbook, or send me a message thru my contact me page and I’ll see if Mom can look it up for you. </p>

		<p>With all the Corona going around still, I hope you all are staying healthy, staying home when possible and staying as sane as possible. I will see you in the next post.</p>
