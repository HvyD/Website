        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">

			<div class="right"><img src="../../img/wantedzombies.JPG" alt="Will Ferrel Wanted Zombies meme"></div>
			<p><em>Hey y’all, what’s up? Monkey Momma here.</em> How y’all holding up? Well, the apocalypse is here. I was hoping for zombies. Zombies would have been fun.  But, nope. It’s a dumb virus. It’s got all the symptoms of a pre-Zombie virus, fever, coughing, respiratory issues… But, so far, no one is coming back as a zombie. Which means we’re all stuck inside and we can’t stab dead people in the head.</p>

			<p>Okay, all kidding aside, this is a fairly serious issue.  People are dying and getting very sick.  People are recovering, as well, but people are still getting sick with very severe symptoms. As I am writing this blog, it is Day seven of us doing shelter in place, and we had day four of #coronahomeschool here at the DFam Cave yesterday.  California has been on a mandatory “stay at home” order for, like, 36 hours, my county for 48.  Phidget_Kitty (aka, the Monkey) has been out of school for over a week, now.  So far, everyone is still alive and healthy. That’s not to say it hasn’t been stressful.</p>

			<div class="right"><img src="../../img/podracecanceled.JPG" alt="Podraces canceled meme"></div>
			<p>All the sports have been canceled. That has made entertainment be a bit more difficult.  I think I'd even watch a Dodgers' game just to get some baseball right about now. Disney+ has or is planning to release a couple movies early due to all the shut downs, which is cool.  </p>

			<div class="left"><img src="../../img/lukegalacticchamp.jpg" alt="Luke Skywalker"></div>
			<p>As my followers know, I have a few chronic medical conditions that affect my immune system and make illness affect me worse than most people, so we have been super careful to follow the social distancing rules.

			<div class="right"><img src="../../img/liloinroom.JPG" alt="Lilo and Stitch meme"></div>
				Not that I don’t normally keep my distance from people if possible, due to my anxiety issues. The “stay at home” order is actually easier for me than many, since my preference is to stay at home, away from others.  For Phidget_Kitty, however, it is not as easy.  She is a bit of a social butterfly and is missing her friends badly. </p>

			<p>The “homeschool” program is actually going well.  Her instructors have emailed us lessons she does on online platforms, such as Khan Academy, Google Classroom, and NewsELA.  She says its easier to learn without classmates being loud and disruptive around her.  She has also been working on learning Japanese, building a robot with HvyD (my husband) and is working on reading the Harry Potter novels.  So, on the in the house front, we’re doing well.</p>

      <p>The outside world is a bit more worrisome. Well, it’s always worrisome, but it’s worse now.  And, I don’t mean because of the virus.  People are going insane out there. They are “panic buying” large quantities of goods, like the stores are never going to get restocked.  The problem then becomes, no one else can get what they need.
			<div class="right"><img src="../../img/emptywm.JPG" alt="Empty Meat case at Walmart"></div>
			We’ve been trying to do our regular shopping, and the stores are cleared out. At the Walmart we shop at, the other day the shelves were almost empty.  It wasn’t just cleaning supplies and toilet paper, it was meats, cereals, water… Oddly, they did have a lot of seafood left. Maybe people here just don’t know how to cook seafood? </p>

		  <p>One thing that really worries me is, why weren’t people buying cleaning supplies, hand sanitizer and hand soap before? Like, seriously, that’s just disgusting folks.

		  <div class="left"><img src="../../img/BYsanitizer.JPG" alt="The Child meme"></div>
			If you were properly cleaning your homes and hands before all this hoopla, you would know how much you need to stay healthy and you would not have to buy it all.  And, I don’t get the toilet paper thing. Really folks, the truckers will keep delivering. If you hadn’t bought 100,000 packages, we’d all be able to buy some.  At least places aren’t allowing these people who over bought to sell on eBay and stuff to return it. They’re gonna have toilet paper forever, lol. Hopefully, the next time we venture out of the DFam cave, the shelves will be restocked.</p>

	    <p>Anyhow, that’s all for today. Everyone stay safe out there. The website should be going live in the next couple days from me writing this. We got the domain bought last night and signed up for a host/server thing. If you’re reading this close to March 21-23, 2020, we got it up as planned, lol.</p>
