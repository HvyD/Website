		  <p><em>Hey y’all, what’s up?</em> Some of you know me, already, but I guess it’s time for an official introduction. My name is Karin, but I go by Monkey Momma here on the interwebs. As I keep promising on my YouTube videos, there’s an expansion of the Monkey Momma Creations brand in the works. As part of this expansion, I am launching this website with a blog, some tutorials, and a store where I will eventually sell some of my art and other random stuff. </p>
	    <p>I am not a fan of the limitations sites like WordPress have on their systems, nor do I really like any of the layouts they provide, especially on the free version. And really, when you are just starting out in this blog/vlog empire, who can afford $300 to get a site you can sell things and get ad revenue on? So, I figured, hey, I learned HTML way back in the 1990s in college, why don’t I just build my own website? How hard could it be? Famous last words, there, lol. </p>
	    <p>I soon learned HTML is now HTML5. Yeah, five versions have come out in the years since I worked with html in school. I needed more than just a refresher, I needed to learn a whole new system. The CSS protocols that were just being talked about back then are now on version 3! And some new language called JavaScript exists now? Okay, I discovered I needed to learn a few things to make this happen. I enrolled in a Web Development Specialization Program from the University of Michigan thru Coursera. Some of you may have stumbled on this site as the Capstone Project for that program, others may just have stumbled on my site. I did promise things are really random in this enterprise, lol. </p>
	    <p>So, who is Monkey Momma? Well, I’m a mom, newly disabled and trying to launch this brand as therapy of sorts. The Monkey is my daughter. She acquired her nickname due to her crazy antics in utero, and it was cemented during her toddler years when she started climbing pretty much anything that stood still. I live in Northern California, with the Monkey and my wonderful husband.  I have fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety, among a few other conditions, that all limit my life in various ways. <i>They are all “invisible” conditions, meaning, you can’t tell just by looking at me, which adds to the struggle.</i> One of the major parts of this blog/vlog empire is talking about how these conditions have changed my life, and what I am doing to adapt to my new normal.</p>
		  <p>I love Metallica, <font color="#FD5A1E">the San Francisco Giants</font>, Star Wars, Disney, crafting, my family, and my cats. The order of hierarchy there fluctuates by the day, lol. I like several other kinds of music, including Jimmy Buffett, country, rock, rap, Jazz, and basically anything but pop music. I am a diehard fan of the Giants, but I also love the Oakland Athletics, and am a general fan of all baseball, except the Dodgers. <em><strong>The Dodgers suck.</strong></em> No sense in trying to change my mind on that, it’s just a fact. I actually have several “fandoms”; I’m pretty geeky in many ways, but my two main ones are Star Wars and Disney. I also love Doctor Who, Firefly, Harry Potter, Demon Slayer, and a bunch of other stuff. I enjoy making various arts and crafts, from stuff on my Cricut to making cups and jewelry with epoxy and sewing. I’m not a master at any of it, but I can produce some nice stuff.  I’m mostly self-taught in crafting, and now am working on basically becoming a self-taught full stack ninja using Coursera, Udacity and other resources. YouTube has also been my friend on much of this journey.  Now, I am trying to share some of what I’ve learned and things I picked up through trial and error with others and keep myself busy to slow the progression of the conditions I find myself fighting now.</p>
